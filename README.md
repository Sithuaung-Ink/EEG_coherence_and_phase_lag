# EEG_coherence_and_phase_lag
Calculating coherence between two EEG signals involves several steps, including calculating the cross-power spectral density (CSD) and the power spectral densities (PSD) of the individual signals.
The Phase Lag Index (PLI) is a measure of phase synchronization between two EEG signals.
